**WEAPON DETECTON AND ALERT SYSTEM**

This repository contains a YOLOv8-powered weapon detection project tailored for video-based security and surveillance applications.
The system processes video streams such as CCTV footage or live webcam feeds to detect weapons in real-time. 
It can identify various types of weapons, including grenades, guns, pistols, rifles, and knives. 
Once a weapon is detected, the system draws bounding boxes around it and sends an instant email alert to notify security personnel.
